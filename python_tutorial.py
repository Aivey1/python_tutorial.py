# *** Welcome to the Python Tutorial by Al ***
# In this tutorial, we are going to learn the 'print' command in Python and how to use variables.
# We will also take user input and display it back to the screen using the 'print' command.
# Let's get started!

# This line prints a welcome message to the user
print("*** Welcome to Learn Python: The 'Print' Command Tutorial ***")

# Asking the user if they're ready to learn
ready = input("Are you ready to learn? (Y/N): ")  # User input stored in 'ready' variable

# Displaying what the user answered
print(f"You answered: {ready}")

# Asking the user what they think the 'print' command does
guess = input("What do you think the 'print' command does? ")  # User's guess stored in 'guess' variable

# Responding to the user after their guess
print("Okay, times up!")
print(f"If you thought '{guess}' was the right answer, that's a good guess!")

# Displaying the correct answer
print("In Python, the 'print' command displays text or data on the screen.")

# Showing the syntax of the 'print' command
print("----------------------------------------")
print('Here is the syntax for the "print" command in Python:')
print('print("Text to display on the screen.")')
print("----------------------------------------")

# Showing an example of using the 'print' command
print('Example: Let\'s print the phrase "Python is fun!"')
print('print("Python is fun!")')
print("The result will be displayed as:")
print("Python is fun!")  # This will print the phrase Python is fun!

# Wrapping up the tutorial
